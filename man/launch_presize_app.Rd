\title{Presize shiny app}
\usage{
launch_presize_app()
}
\description{
Besides the programmatic approach to using presize, we also supply a shiny app,
enabling point-and-click interaction with the program. The app will open in a
new window. Select the appropriate method from the menu on the left and enter
the relevant parameters indicated in the panel on the right. The output is then
displayed lower down the page.
}
\details{
The main disadvantage to the app is that it only allows a single scenario at
a time.

The app is also available at \href{https://shiny.ctu.unibe.ch/presize/}{https://shiny.ctu.unibe.ch/presize/}.
