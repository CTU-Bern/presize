[Bland (2009)](https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3985) recommended to
base study sizes on the width of the confidence interval rather the power of 
a statistical test. The goal of `presize` is to provide functions for such 
precision based sample size calculations. For a given sample size, the 
functions will return the precision (width of the confidence interval), and 
vice versa.

## Installation

`presize` can be installed from CRAN in the usual manner:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("presize")
```


You can install the development version of `presize` with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('presize', repos = 'https://ctu-bern.r-universe.dev')
```

## Overview
presize provides functions for

Rate | `prec_rate` | Score, variance stabilizing, exact, Wald [see @barker2002]
**Absolute differences** | |
Mean difference | `prec_meandiff` |
Risk difference | `prec_riskdiff` | Newcombe [@newcombe1998], Miettinen-Nurminen [@mn1985], Agresti-Caffo [@ac2000], Wald
**Relative differences** | |
Odds ratio | `prec_or` | Gart, Wolff, independence smoothed logit [see @fll2015]
Risk ratio | `prec_riskratio` | Koopman [@koopman1984], Katz [@kbap1978]

<sup>1</sup> Simple wrappers for `prec_prop`.

<sup>2</sup> Wrappers for `prec_lr` with values provided via sens and spec

## Example

Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of hospital admissions with diabetes. 
Diabetes has a prevalence of approximately 10% (@diab). We assume a 
slightly higher proportion of diabetics, 
15%, as diabetes is a risk factor for a wide range of conditions. We want to 
estimate the prevalence of diabetes to within 5% (plus/minus 2.5%). With `presize`,
this is simple. We use the `prec_prop` (precision of a proportion) function and pass 
our 15% and 5% as arguments `p` and `conf.width`:

```{r}
library(presize) # load the package
prec_prop(p = 0.15, conf.width = 0.05)
```


In the n column, we see that we would need to ask 784 (rounding 783.5 up) patients to achieve the desired CI width. 
Disappointingly, we also know that we only have funds to collect the data from 
600 patients. 
We wonder if 600 patients would yield sufficient precision - we could 
also accept a CI width of 6% (plus/minus 3%).
In such a case, we can pass the arguments `p` and `n`.

```{r}
prec_prop(p = 0.15, n = 600)
```

Now we see that with 600 patients, the CI would have a width of 
5.7%. We are happy with this and continue planning our study with those values. 
All of the functions listed in Table 1 can be used similarly.

We can also look at a range of scenarios simulatenously by passing a vector to 
one of the arguments, which could be used to create something analogous to a 
power curve: 

```{r}
prec_prop(p = 0.15, n = seq(600, 800, 50))
```


## Shiny app

An online interactive version of the package is available [here](https://shiny.ctu.unibe.ch/presize). The app can also be launched locally via `launch_presize_app()` in RStudio.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/app.png")
```
