[Bland (2009)](https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3985) recommended to
base study sizes on the width of the confidence interval rather the power of 
a statistical test. The goal of `presize` is to provide functions for such 
precision based sample size calculations. For a given sample size, the 
functions will return the precision (width of the confidence interval), and 
vice versa.

## Installation

`presize` can be installed from CRAN in the usual manner:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("presize")
```


You can install the development version of `presize` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/presize")
```

Note that `remotes` treats any warnings (e.g. that a certain package was built under a different version of R) as errors. If you see such an error, run the following line and try again:

```{r remotes-error, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = "true")
```


## Overview
presize will provide functions for

* descriptive statistics
    + mean (`prec_mean`)
    + proportion (`prec_prop`)
    + rate (`prec_rate`)
  
* absolute and relative differences
    + mean difference (`prec_meandiff`)
    + risk difference (`prec_riskdiff`)
    + odds ration (`prec_or`)
    + risk ratio (`prec_riskratio`)
    + rate ratio (`prec_rateratio`)
<!--    + hazard ratio -->
  
* correlation measures
    + correlation coefficient (`prec_cor`)
    + Cohens kappa (`prec_kappa`)
    + ICC (`prec_icc`)
    + limit of agreement from Bland Altman plot (`prec_lim_agree`)
  
* diagnostic measures
    + sens (`prec_sens`<sup>1</sup>)
    + spec (`prec_spec`<sup>1</sup>)
    + likelihood ratios (`prec_lr`)
      + positive likelihood ratio (`prec_pos_lr`<sup>2</sup>)
      + negative likelihood ratio (`prec_neg_lr`<sup>2</sup>)
    + AUC (`prec_auc`)
    
<sup>1</sup> Simple wrappers for `prec_prop`.

<sup>2</sup> Wrappers for `prec_lr` with values provided via sens and spec

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(presize)

# calculate sample size for a proportion of 0.2, or 0.4 with a precision of 0.2
prec_prop(p = c(.2, .4), n = 10, method = "wilson")
```

The problem being addressed is 'how wide is the confidence interval width, given proportions of events of 20 and 40% and only 10 participants'.


## Shiny app

An online interactive version of the package is available [here](https://ctu-bern.shinyapps.io/presize). The app can also be launched locally via `launch_presize_app()` in RStudio.

## Funding

`presize` was largely developed at CTU Bern, with collaboration from CTU Basel. Funding was provided by the Swiss Clinical Trial Organisation.
